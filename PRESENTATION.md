# JavaScript Obfuscation and Deobfuscation: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to JavaScript and Obfuscation

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive elements on web pages. From enhancing user interfaces with animations to handling server requests in the background via AJAX, JavaScript is an integral part of the modern web. For more details, please refer to the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).

Obfuscation, on the other hand, is the practice of making something hard to understand or interpret. In the context of JavaScript, obfuscation involves transforming the code into a version that is functionally equivalent but much harder to read and understand. This is done to protect the code from being easily reverse-engineered or stolen.
