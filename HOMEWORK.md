# Homework Assignment: JavaScript Deobfuscation

## Objective

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of JavaScript obfuscation and deobfuscation techniques. You will be given an obfuscated JavaScript code, and your task is to deobfuscate it and describe the original functionality of the code.

## Instructions

1. **Deobfuscation**: The following JavaScript code has been obfuscated. Your task is to deobfuscate it and restore it to its original form.

    ```javascript
    var _0x12cd=['\x72\x65\x74\x75\x72\x6E'];(function(_0x5a22d3,_0x12cd55){var _0x2e8787=function(_0x287a22){while(--_0x287a22){_0x5a22d3['\x70\x75\x73\x68'](_0x5a22d3['\x73\x68\x69\x66\x74']());}};_0x2e8787(++_0x12cd55);}(_0x12cd,0x1a3));var _0x2e87=function(_0x5a22d3,_0x12cd55){_0x5a22d3=_0x5a22d3-0x0;var _0x2e8787=_0x12cd[_0x5a22d3];return _0x2e8787;};function factorial(_0x287a22){if(_0x287a22===0x0){return 0x1;}else{return _0x287a22*factorial(_0x287a22-0x1);}}
    ```
